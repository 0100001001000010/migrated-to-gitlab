# migrated-to-gitlab
As you know, I have migrated to GitLab because Microsoft has bought GitHub. I am keeping my GitHub account in case I want to contribute to any projects that do not migrate. Because of that, here is what is happening to my stuff:

## My active repositories
Those are getting migrated and are keeping the same name, except for my GitHub Pages repo which has been renamed to 0100001001000010.gitlab.io. They are being archived on GitHub.
## My abandoned repositories
Those stay archived on GitHub and will not be migrated to GitLab.
## Repositories I contributed to
My copy is going to stay archived on GitHub and not be migrated. I don't get to decide what happens to the upstream repository.

This repository is not being archived.
